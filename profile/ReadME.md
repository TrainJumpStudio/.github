# TrainJumpStudio
Train Jump Studio is an independent game development studio dedicated to creating immersive and innovative gaming experiences. Our team is passionate about pushing the boundaries of storytelling and gameplay to deliver unique and memorable adventures for players around the world.

We are currently focused on developing our debut title, Beneath The Wires. This top-down futuristic game is set in a dystopian future ravaged by AI. Players will navigate through a complex world filled with challenges, unraveling the mysteries of a society controlled by advanced artificial intelligence. The game promises a gripping narrative, strategic gameplay, and a richly detailed environment that will captivate and engage gamers.

In addition to our development efforts, we are committed to building a strong and interactive community. We regularly stream games on Twitch every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, offering a mix of gameplay, behind-the-scenes insights, and engaging commentary. Our streams feature popular titles such as Minecraft, PUBG, and Elden Ring, allowing us to connect with fans and fellow gamers in real-time.

We believe in the power of community support and invite you to join us on our journey. By visiting our Ko-fi page [ko-fi.com/trainjumpstudio](https://ko-fi.com/trainjumpstudio), you can contribute to the development of Beneath The Wires and help us bring our creative vision to life.
